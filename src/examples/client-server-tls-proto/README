README

This is a small example on how a client and server can communicate by sending
protobufs over a TLS encrypted link.  The certs do not have to be 
signed/verified.  This is a test case for P2P usage using TOFU[1], much 
like ssh.  This allows peers to connect to anonymous other peers, but be able 
to sell if it's the same peer when they reconnect.

The server and client print the other peers public key when they connect.  The plan is to track
reputation and behavior over time, based on the public key.

To generate certs:
	$ ./makecert.sh AnyInvalidOrValidEmail.com

To regenerate the protobuf based code:
	$ ./make-proto.sh 

To run the server:
	$ go run server/main.go

To run the client:
	$ go run client/main.go
